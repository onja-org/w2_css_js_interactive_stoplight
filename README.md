# Interactive Stoplight - CSS & JavaScript Lab

This repository contains a hands-on lab for learning how JavaScript can control CSS animations and transitions to create interactive web experiences.

## Lab Overview

Students will build a fully functional traffic light controller that demonstrates the powerful combination of CSS styling with JavaScript interaction. The project emphasizes using CSS for all visual effects while JavaScript handles the logic and timing.

### What You'll Build

- ðŸš¦ A realistic-looking traffic light with smooth transitions
- ðŸŽ¯ Interactive button controls to cycle through light states
- âœ¨ CSS animations triggered by JavaScript events
- ðŸŽ‰ Special celebration effects when the light turns green

### Learning Objectives

- Understand how JavaScript can manipulate CSS classes to control styling
- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling
- Explore the synergy between CSS transitions/animations and JavaScript
- Build confidence in combining multiple web technologies

### Key Concepts Covered

- **DOM Querying**: Using `document.querySelector()` to find elements
- **Event Handling**: Adding click listeners to interactive elements
- **CSS Class Management**: Using `classList.add()` and `classList.remove()`
- **CSS Transitions**: Creating smooth state changes
- **CSS Animations**: Adding visual flair with keyframes
- **State Management**: Tracking application state with JavaScript variables
